# House-price-prediction--R

## A small house price prediction model in R

## Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a regression model to predict housing prices based on key features such as lot area and total basement square footage. This model aims to assist real estate analysts and buyers in making informed property valuation decisions.

## Methodology

### Data Exploration and Preprocessing
- **Data Overview**: The dataset includes features like sale price, lot area, and total basement square footage.
- **Data Cleaning**: Ensured proper data formatting and handled missing values.
- **Feature Selection**: Focused on key predictors such as lot area and total basement square footage for price estimation.

### Model Development
- **Regression Model**: Implemented a linear regression model to understand relationships between house prices and features.
- **Model Implementation**: Built a simple regression model using R with the formula:
  ```r
  Regression <- lm(SalePrice ~ LotArea + TotalBsmtSF, data=housing)
  ```
- **Prediction**: Used the model to predict house prices for new data points.

### Evaluation Metrics
- Evaluated model performance using standard regression metrics:
  - **R-squared**: Measures the proportion of variance explained by the model.
  - **Residual Analysis**: Examined residual plots to check model assumptions.
  - **Coefficient Significance**: Analyzed statistical significance of predictors.

## Results
- The regression model provided insights into how lot area and basement size influence housing prices.
- Predictions demonstrated a reasonable approximation of real-world housing prices.
- Future improvements may include:
  - Expanding the dataset with additional features like neighborhood, year built, and number of bedrooms.
  - Using advanced regression techniques like polynomial regression or random forest regression.
  
## How to Run
1. Load the dataset in R:
   ```r
   housing <- read.csv("housing1.csv", sep=",")
   ```
2. Perform summary statistics:
   ```r
   summary(housing)
   ```
3. Fit the regression model:
   ```r
   Regression <- lm(SalePrice ~ LotArea + TotalBsmtSF, data=housing)
   summary(Regression)
   ```
4. Visualize the regression results:
   ```r
   plot(Regression)
   ```
5. Make a prediction for a new house:
   ```r
   newhouse <- data.frame(LotArea=1500, TotalBsmtSF=1200)
   predict(Regression, newhouse)
   ```
